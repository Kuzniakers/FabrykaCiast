## Project Structure

The project consists of several key classes:

- `Cake`: Represents a cake with a name, type, and a list of ingredients.
- `ICakeFactory`: Interface for cake factories.
- `ChocolateCakeFactory` / `AppleCakeFactory`: Implementations of the cake factories.
- `BakingSchedule`: The main class that manages the cake baking schedule.

## Usage Example

The following example demonstrates how to add a chocolate cake and an apple cake to the baking schedule and display the schedule:

```csharp
var bakingSchedule = new BakingSchedule();
bakingSchedule.AddCake(new ChocolateCakeFactory());
bakingSchedule.AddCake(new AppleCakeFactory());

bakingSchedule.DisplaySchedule();
